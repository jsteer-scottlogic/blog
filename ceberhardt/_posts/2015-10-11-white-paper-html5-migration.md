This white paper explores and addresses the importance of migrating complex business applications from Flex and Silverlight to HTML5. It highlights the risks involved in delaying your migration and provides a solution that tackles cost concerns at the same time as delivering an early return on investment.

The paper covers:
- Why HTML5 has won the web
- The key reasons to migrate now, rather than continue to postpone
- The migration strategies available and the pros and cons of each
- How your users can influence a staged migration

The white paper is [free to download in PDF format]({{site.baseurl}}/ceberhardt/assets/white-papers/html5-migration.pdf).
