summary: In this month’s episode, we talk multi-cloud. This is a challenging topic,
  even the first step—nailing down what the term actually means—isn’t easy. How does
  it differ from hybrid-cloud or poly-cloud? Does the term refer to the deployment
  approach for a single application or an entire organisation?

In this month’s episode, we talk multi-cloud. This is a challenging topic, even the first step—nailing down what the term actually means—isn’t easy. How does it differ from hybrid-cloud or poly-cloud? Does the term refer to the deployment approach for a single application or an entire organisation?

We discuss the challenges of creating a multi-cloud architecture, dealing with multiple cloud vendors, and why you might follow this path.

Colin is joined by colleagues James Heward and Robert Griffiths to compare thoughts and experiences gained from many years of architecting solutions for the cloud.
